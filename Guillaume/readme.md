- https://domestika.com

  Domestika is a creative community plateform where creative experts share their knowledge and skills through professionally produced online courses. 
  It all started as an online forum and a small but dynamic showcase of creative professionals, designed to help them connect and learn from each other.
  Domestika carefully curates the teacher roster and produces all the courses in-house, to ensure a high-quality online learning experience for everyone.

  Messy plateform of online courses, but with interesting "Meilleures catégories" on their main page

- https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/

  I would inspire myself of Mozilla Developper website, as codeArtShop is a selling plateform of code, for me it makes sense as a developper not-so-private joke.

- https://mediamarkt.be/fr and https://www.decathlon.be/fr/

  I would inspire myself of both for their menu and search engine (filters, categories etc.)
  
- https://amazon.fr

  Amazon website can be a good ressources for default choice when thinking about the patern of my website.
  Of course, I will try to simplify it as my plateform would only be used by one seller for a more limited and precise range of product.
