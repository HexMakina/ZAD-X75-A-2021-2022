## 3. E-commerce website inspirations ##

- https://itch.io
  
  Itch.io is a website for users to host, sell and download indie games.
  Itch.io also allows users to host game jams, events where participants have limited time (usually 1–3 days) to create a game.
  
- https://flexibits.com/

  Flexibits describe themself as creator (and seller) of enjoyable and flexible apps.
  What do they mean by flexible? Apps that make your life better. Apps that remove frustration.

  "We're users too, so we know what a good user experience should be. If you're disappointed or frustrated with anything, please let us know. With many years of    experience working on many popular apps, our hope is that our experience and passion comes through in everything we do.

- https://procreate.art and https://affinity.serif.com/fr
  
  Creative drawing app editors
  
- https://class101.co

  Class101 is a plateform selling over 1000+ online classes to creators.
  Class101 helps creators to produce and market their own course every step of the way (before Class101 commit to film and edit a new class, they run ads on campaign page to test its market potential)
  
- https://domestika.com

  Domestika is a creative community plateform where creative experts share their knowledge and skills through professionally produced online courses. 
  It all started as an online forum and a small but dynamic showcase of creative professionals, designed to help them connect and learn from each other.
  Domestika carefully curates the teacher roster and produces all the courses in-house, to ensure a high-quality online learning experience for everyone.

- https://udemy.com

  Messy plateform of online courses, but with interesting "Meilleures catégories" on their main page

- https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/

  I would inspire myself of Mozilla Developper website, as codeArtShop is a selling plateform of code, for me it makes sense as a developper not-so-private joke.

- https://mediamarkt.be/fr and https://www.decathlon.be/fr/

  I would inspire myself of both for their menu and search engine (filters, categories etc.)
  
- https://amazon.fr

  Amazon website can be a good ressources for default choice when thinking about the patern of my website.
  Of course, I will try to simplify it as my plateform would only be used by one seller for a more limited and precise range of product.
